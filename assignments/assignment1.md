# Assignment 1

## Domains

**Reading books**: I don’t particularly enjoy reading, but I know that it’s good for me and has always helped me progress far in life during the periods when I read frequently. I enjoy reading about entrepreneurship, business skills, marketing, and books that will make a direct impact on my life for the better.

**Task lists**: I live by task lists. Anything I need to do will get placed on a task list. I have many things going on in my life that I need to keep organized and simplified. If I don’t, then I will forget to do something important that will only have negative consequences or just make my life a bit harder than it has to be.

**Bills/Subscriptions**: I pay for a ton of subscriptions and also pay bills frequently. My subscriptions are all over the place spanning across multiple cards to maximize reward points. It gets a bit confusing sometimes and sneaky charges do occur.

**Calling customer service**: I live in an immigrant household, and we’re always calling customer service since my parents aren’t too familiar with navigating a website to get things done. They usually resort to calling customer service and I am always the person who hops on the call and explains or resolves everything.

**Travel**: My family and I traveled together for the first time this summer to Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. It was a nice experience, but we were very confused about many things related to logistics. Examples include visas, booking hotels, organizing pickup cars, and the laws of each country. I wish there were an easy way to know what you need for each country before traveling there, and not missing something important logistically.

**Employees**: I run an online business where I have to hire employees every so often. I’m not a huge fan of the initial filtering process of candidates. I wish there were an easier way to get to the best candidates quicker.

**Running Ads**: For my business, I run a lot of ads on Facebook. Per week, I run about 15 - 30 ads. However, I don’t have a lot of time to review or analyze why some of my ads work and don’t work. This is something I look to improve on, just don’t know a better way than just sitting down and going through them one by one and taking notes.

**Being Productive**: I would call myself a productive person who works a lot. I enjoy working because I am grateful for my opportunity to be in a first-world country and live a wonderful life. Sometimes, I do get distracted and start doomscrolling on social media. It hurts my mental capacity and I don’t feel good after doing it. I also sacrifice socializing and going out more to work. I wish I could escape this somehow.

**Fitness**: I recently started caring more about my health and trying to work out and eat healthier. I want to live a good life and not face many health-related issues as I age. It is hard sometimes to keep up with this lifestyle when you see food you’d dream of eating readily accessible. Being consistent with workouts is also difficult when your vision of ‘why’ becomes blurry.

**Remembering everything**: I have an immigrant family that can only speak English to get by. I’m the one in charge of jotting down everyone’s passwords to various online tools and services, remembering where important things are kept around the house, reading mail, and filling out forms.

## Problems

### Reading books

**Problem 1**: Distracted when reading

Unfortunately, my mind races and I get distracted easily, causing me to reread pages, which ultimately demotivates me from even continuing to read. These consistent demotivating moments build up and ultimately stop me from reading for long periods of time. I wish there were a way to stop myself from treating reading as a passive activity, but rather as an active activity where my mind won’t wander, and I can absorb the material the first time around.

**Problem 2**: Knowing which book to read next

I chose not to include this because these days I feel as if you can simply ask AI to help you choose a good next book. Existing chatbots like ChatGPT can give great recommendations based on books you like and books you’ve read. It doesn’t seem like a big or complex enough problem to pursue.

**Problem 3**: Understanding and remembering a book’s lessons

I chose not to select this problem because the solution is too trivial. You can simply read actively and write down notes, thoughts, and lessons on a notepad while you read. The basic solution works just fine, and a whole app is not needed to solve this problem.

### Task lists

**Problem 1**: Many tasks to do

My mind races frequently. It’s not a great combination when there’s an abundance of tasks to do. I get overwhelmed and resort to brain-rotting instead. I’d like to figure out how to tackle my task list more effectively, rather than abandoning it when times get tough.

**Problem 2**: Main task list on notebook and laptop

I decided not to choose this because it might not be a widespread problem for me to solve. The easy solution would be to just have a synced task list using digital devices. Instead of a physical notebook, you can use a tablet to sync a task list with your laptop so it’s always up to date on both devices.

**Problem 3**: Finishing daily tasks

I decided not to select this problem because it’s more of a motivation issue. Finishing daily tasks has to do with self-sufficiency and reward. It’s about how willing and motivated you are to finish what’s on your task list. The other easy solution could be that you simply have too many tasks on your task list, and it needs to be reduced to a more manageable daily workload.

### Remembering everything

**Problem 1**: Keeping track of everything

It’s hard to keep track of everything and not get mentally lost. Ideally, I would like to fix this issue organizationally so I can have a bit more mental peace.

**Problem 2**: Teaching everyone to take care of their own things

I decided not to pursue this problem because it’s less software-related. Teaching someone to take care of their own things would require more in-person human interaction.

**Problem 3**: Storing Everything in One Place

Although this is a real concern, it feels more like a cybersecurity and best-practices issue than a problem that fits well into a course project. Existing solutions like password managers (1Password, LastPass) and cloud storage with encryption already address these risks effectively. Building a new tool focused purely on security/privacy would also be technically complex and shift the project toward cybersecurity rather than organization and usability, which is the problem space I want to stay in.

## Stakeholders

### Reading books

**Reader** (the one reading the book and engaging with the app)

**Publisher/Author** (interested in fairer reviews and more attentive readers)

**Impacts**: Reader suffers from getting distracted when reading. Publisher/Author might have interest in reader spending more attention to their book because it may give the book a fairer review, the author a fairer judgement, or even convince the reader to read more books by the same author.

### Task lists

**Lister** (user who is responsible for adding tasks to the task list)

**Teacher** (someone who is a current teacher/professor of Lister)

**Parent** (parent of Lister)

**Group Member** (someone who is in a group with Lister, either as a friend, coworker, group mate for project, etc).

**Impacts**: Lister gets overwhelmed when there is an abundance of tasks in the task list. Teacher has interest in Lister getting their academic-related tasks done. Parent has interest in Lister getting all their tasks done and not being overwhelmed and stressed. Group Member prefers if Lister gets their task done because it also affects them in some way (group project, friends hang-out time, etc)

### Remembering everything

**Rememberer** (user who is in charge of remembering everything for immigrant family)

**Family** (family of Rememberer who need things remembered for them)

**Institutions** (the entities from which the passwords, mail, forms, etc, come from)

**Impacts**: Rememberer suffers from tracking whole family’s things. Family benefits from Rememberer keeping track of all their information and suffers if rememberer does not keep track of anything specific. Institutions benefit from people remembering their passwords, reading their mail, filling out their forms, etc.
